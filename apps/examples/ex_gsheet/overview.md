To run this example, you'll need to provide a URL to a gsheet that you can access. Just replace
the url in the `MY-URL` definition with your URL and uncomment the second `MAIN-PAGE` definition
in the `main.forthic` file.

The first time you run an example that pulls data from a gsheet, you'll be guided to
provide a client ID and client secret for an "app" that will make calls on your
behalf. If you don't have an app, it's easy to set one up -- see [Google Dev Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to get started.

This example pulls data from your gsheet tab and prints it out.
