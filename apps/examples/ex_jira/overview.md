Before you can use the Jira module to interact with Jira, you need to provide a "Jira context" in which to
run in. This provides the host and user credentials information. The first time you run this example,
you will be guided to enter this information, which will be stored encrypted in the `.secrets` file in the
`apps` directory.

This example shows how to provide JQL and an array of fields to make a query against Jira.

The output is generated by converting each ticket record to a string and then joining with a `<br>` so
each record appears on one line in the output.
