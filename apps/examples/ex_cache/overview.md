This example shows how the `cache` module can be used to store information for future use.

Here, we store an array of strings in the cache under the key "greek". We define a word
`GREEK` that retrieves the data from cache and we use this in rendering the example output.

Once this is example is run, take a look at the `ex_cache/.cache` file to see how the data is stored.
